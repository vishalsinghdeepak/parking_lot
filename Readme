The project has been developed using c++. In order to execute the project in Ubuntu follow the below steps
Execute g++ -o parking_lot main.cpp
Or you can directly execute the command ./setup.sh : This command will compile the code and resolve all the dependencies and will create the executable file "parking_lot"


Now you are ready to run the program.
